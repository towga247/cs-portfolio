# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! This is a collection of my hands-on cybersecurity learning experiences and projects as I progress through:

- TryHackMe
- Hack The Box
- Pwn College
- Western Governors University (B.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance)
- Independent Projects and Labs

Each section contains write-ups, notes, and scripts I've created while solving challenges or completing coursework. This repo serves as my public knowledge base and a showcase of my skills and growth.
